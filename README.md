<a name="footnote1">1</a>: Drug spending data for Arizonaâ€™s Medicaid program in 2008 and 2009 was unavailable at the time of publication.

<a name="footnote2">2</a>: Enrollment counts from 2008 through 2014 represent anyone who had at least one day of Medicaid coverage in the year, while figures from 2015 through 2016 represent the highest monthly enrollment in the year. Additionally, full data for a handful of states was unavailable in 2012 or 2013 so data from the previous year was used.
